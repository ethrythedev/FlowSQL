# FlowSQL
Manage your databases like a breeze

## FlowSQL is...
FlowSQL is an easy-to-use and modern web interface for MySQL and MariaDB. It is simple to download & install onto your web server and can be easily removed if required.

## Requirements
FlowSQL requires at least:
* PHP 8.0.0 or newer
* Apache or NGINX
* MySQL or MariaDB 8.0 or newer

We recommend:
* PHP 8.2.0 or newer
* Latest version of Apache
* MySQL or MariaDB 10.4 or newer

## Download
To download FlowSQL, you can go to [Releases](https://github.com/ethrythedev/FlowSQL/releases) and download the latest ZIP file. If you prefer to download via the repo or git, you can do that too.

## Installation
To install FlowSQL, simply unzip the release ZIP file in a "FlowSQL" folder on your web root directory (e.g. /var/www/html, /xampp/htdocs). You should then be able to access FlowSQL at http://127.0.0.1/FlowSQL.

You do not need to make any changes to your database as all changes will be made through the logged in user account.

You can configure your installation in config.yml.

## Updating
An auto updater is currently under works. Once an update arrives, you currently have to download it from GitHub and replace every file manually. You can then change the config.yml file again to your needs.
