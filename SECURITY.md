## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any unfixed security issues (minor or severe), please tell me via a DM on Discord, or Twitter **before** publishing it. If possible, please allow 6-12 hours before you publish it. This way, a fix will be prepared. You will also be given credit in our release notice if requested.
